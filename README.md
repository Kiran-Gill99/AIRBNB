üè† Airbnb Data Analysis and Insights

**üìñ Overview**

Welcome to the Airbnb Data Analysis and Insights project! This report provides a comprehensive overview of our endeavor to enhance the Airbnb experience through data analysis. We explore industry dynamics, the problem we address, our project's differentiation, data gathering methods, and the key components comprising our project.

**Industry/Domain Insights**

Introduction to the Short-Term Accommodation Rental Industry:
The short-term accommodation rental industry has experienced remarkable growth, with the global market projected to reach $124.28 billion by 2027. This sector encompasses a diverse range of accommodations, from apartments and houses to unique and unconventional lodging options.

**Problem and Opportunity**

Problem Statement:
Our focus is on enhancing the Airbnb experience for both hosts and guests, specifically addressing the challenges of inaccurate pricing and recommendations. Hosts struggle to set the right property price, and guests often face difficulties finding accommodations that precisely match their preferences. Lower user satisfaction and revenue losses due to inefficient pricing quantify this problem.

**Opportunity for Improvement:**
Solving these challenges presents a significant opportunity for both Airbnb and its users. Improving pricing and recommendations allows us to provide a more tailored experience for guests, increasing satisfaction and loyalty. For hosts, our solution translates to increased occupancy rates, better retention, and higher revenue, aligning with Airbnb's growth objectives.

**Data Gathering**
Datasets Used:
Our project relies on several datasets, including Airbnb listings, reviews, and booking history. These datasets are sourced from Airbnb's API and publicly available data, allowing us to create a comprehensive view of the platform. Data features include property type, location, price, reviews, and more.
